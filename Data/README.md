## Organization

`ecoli_info/`: includes data files used as *E. coli* genome reference, files with species-specific metrics of CUB, and files used to classify core and essential genes.

`genes_GCI/`: includes files containing lists of genes with positive or negative GCI values for most data sets, output from `Code/3-explore_expression_and_growth.Rmd`.

`processed_data/`: includes all data sets used in our analysis, which were processed from their original data sources using `Code/1*-process_*.ipynb` scripts.

`raw_data/`: includes local copies of relevant data sets originally published by [Sastry, A. V. et al. (2019)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13483-w), [Schmidt, A. et al. (2016)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3418), and [Yu, R. et al. (2021)](https://elifesciences.org/articles/65722.pdf).

`scer_info`: includes data files used as *S. cerevisiae* genome reference and files with species-specific metrics of CUB for all genes.
